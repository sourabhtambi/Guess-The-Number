# Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation Tool
 This is a C++ program designed to perform polynomial interpolation using the Lagrange Interpolation Method. Given a set of known data points ( 𝑥𝑖 , 𝑦𝑖 )  the program calculates the estimated value of a function at any desired point  𝑥  , where the actual function is unknown or difficult to compute directly.
